CMake works fine with Visual Studio but there are a few things to consider. The
property for the working directory in the Debugging section should most likely
be set to `$(OutDir)`. Likewise, the start-up project must be set manually as
it's set to ALL_BUILD by default. ALL_BUILD is a project that builds all
projects and correctly triggers any scripts. ZERO_CHECK is a project that runs
and, if any CMake files have been changed, asks to reload Visual Studio.

Furthermore, if you're making a Windows application, you should add the WIN32
parameter to `add_executable` to instruct the compiler to use the `WinMain`
