# this is a test for links, references and footnotes. 

a link to [the example.com website](http://www.example.com "example") 

well, [the example.com website](http://www.example.com) 

testing footnotes[^footnote1]. this is kinda silly.^[another footnote.] 
^superscrips^ are ok, but be careful to keep spaces between the inline
footnotes and the superscripts.^[inline footnotes-- *test*]

[^footnote1]: this is a footnote --.

What follows are some notes on algorithms I've been reviewing from [Algorithms](http://amzn.com/032157351X) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://amzn.com/1849967202) by Steven S. Skiena, and other sources around the Internet [^mit] [^umd] [^umgd]. I wanted to write some notes on the material so that I could easily look back on it, but mainly so that I could be sure that I understand the material --- since I have to understand it to explain it.

[Convolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) is a mathematical
method of combining two signals to form a third signal. Passing the [Dirac
delta function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function) (unit
impulse) $\delta[n]$ through a linear system results in the impulse response
$h[n]$. The impulse response is simply the signal resulting from passing the
unit impulse (Dirac delta function) through a linear system.
