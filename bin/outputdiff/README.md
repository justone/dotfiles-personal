# Output Diff

## Overview

Many questions can be answered by looking at the change in the output of a single program.

1. Did that puppet run change the firewall correctly? `iptables -L -n`
1. What files in /var/log were written to as a result of my ssh connection? `ls -al /var/log`
1. Did something change in this tree of files? `tree -as`

Sometimes looking for the differences is easy, but it can be difficult if there are many lines or the differences are in multiple places.  `outputdiff` helps out with the problem by capturing the output and storing it in a git repo for later comparison.  When new output is given, a diff is shown if there were changes.

## Example usage

For a puppet run that adds a firewall rule allowing access to port 8080:

    $ sudo iptables -L -n | outputdiff --new
    INFO: Initialized new capture.
    $ sudo puppet agent --test
    ... snip ...
    $ sudo iptables -L -n | outputdiff --compare
    diff --git a/output b/output
    index 77caab4..c2b4cf4 100644
    --- a/output
    +++ b/output

## Help

    $ outputdiff --help
    Usage:
         $ command --with --output | outputdiff [options]

         Options:
          -n --new <name>           Create the initial version that future output will
                                    be compared against.  The name is optional, if none
                                    is specified, an autogenerated name will be used.
          -m --message <message>    (optional) Specify a message describing the current
                                    output.
          -c --compare <name>       Compare new output against the previous output.
          -l --last <name>          Show most recent diff again.
             --log <name>           Show log of captured output.
             --clean <name>         Remove a comparison.  If no comparison specified, remove all.
             --list                 List all comparisons.
             --vimdiff              Use vimdiff to show differences.  Only works with
                                    --last, not --compare.
             --no-diff              Don't show a diff.  Used with --compare to suppress output.

         Documentation options:
          -v --verbose              Print more details about what the script is doing.
          -t --test                 Don't actually do anything.  Useful when combined
                                    with --verbose.
          -h --help -?              brief help message
             --man                  full documentation
