INTRODUCTION                       *conjure-client-janet-netrepl-introduction*
>
  Janet is a functional and imperative programming language. It runs on
  Windows, Linux, macOS, BSDs, and should run on other systems with some
  porting. The entire language (core library, interpreter, compiler,
  assembler, PEG) is less than 1MB. You can also add Janet scripting to an
  application by embedding a single C file and two headers. 

We can use Janet with Conjure by starting a netrepl server and then opening a
Janet file. Make sure you've installed Janet and the `spork` module then
execute the following:
>
  janet -e "(import spork/netrepl) (netrepl/server)"

You should now be able to evaluate Janet code as you would any other language.
Beware that Janet doesn't have namespaces, this means that the buffers you
evaluate will all stack up on each other, switching buffers doesn't switch
contexts like in Clojure or Fennel.

MAPPINGS                               *conjure-client-janet-netrepl-mappings*

These mappings are the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|.

See |conjure-client-janet-netrepl-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

:ConjureConnect [host] [port]
                         Connect to the given host and port. The host defaults
                         to `127.0.0.1` and the port defaults to `9365`.
                         `:ConjureConnect`
                         `:ConjureConnect 5678`
                         `:ConjureConnect staging.my-app.com 5555`

<localleader>cc          Connect to a running netrepl using the default host
                         and port.

<localleader>cd          Disconnect from the current netrepl.

CONFIGURATION                     *conjure-client-janet-netrepl-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.

                      *g:conjure#client#janet#netrepl#connection#default_host*
`g:conjure#client#janet#netrepl#connection#default_host`
            Host to use when connecting by default. Same as the default
            `spork/netrepl` uses.
            Default: `"127.0.0.1"`

                      *g:conjure#client#janet#netrepl#connection#default_port*
`g:conjure#client#janet#netrepl#connection#default_port`
            Port to use when connecting by default. Same as the default
            `spork/netrepl` uses.
            Default: `"9365"`

                              *g:conjure#client#janet#netrepl#mapping#connect*
`g:conjure#client#janet#netrepl#mapping#connect`
            Connect to a running netrepl using the default host and port.
            Default: `"cc"`

                           *g:conjure#client#janet#netrepl#mapping#disconnect*
`g:conjure#client#janet#netrepl#mapping#disconnect`
            Disconnect from the current netrepl.
            Default: `"cd"`
